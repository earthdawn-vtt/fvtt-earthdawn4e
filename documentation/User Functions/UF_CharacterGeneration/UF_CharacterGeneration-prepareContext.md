this function prepares the context of the character generation prompt. It does so not only at the beginning of the prompt creation, but also on any change made by the user (e.g. switching the discipline will show a different set of discipline talents).

**Technical Information:**
A foundry core function (see [prepareContext](https://foundryvtt.com/api/classes/foundry.applications.api.ApplicationV2.html#_prepareContext) for further information)
