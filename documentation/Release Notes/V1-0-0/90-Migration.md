# Migration

The migration process for the V1.0.0 is pretty extensive since it touches every item and actor available under the old system. In the following we will go through every item and show how every value changed and where to find the setting. The Chapters are using the Actor - and item types of the old System.

This whole chapter will only consider information about the Migration if it differed from the old system of if something was set automatically

### Talent

#### Difficulty setting

Each talent had the option to set the default target diffciulty setting and the group difficulty setting in the old system. These are taken over to the new system with the same selection. if no difficulty was set though, some talents will get an update to allow the users to continue playing, because some talents require a certain setting to work.
The difficulty setting for those special talents are done based on the name (from the Premium Compendium) which might not get items which have a manually changed name.
